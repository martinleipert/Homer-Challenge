# Homer Challenge

My contribution to the ICFHR2022 Competition on Detection and Recognition of Greek Letters on Papyri.

Based on the dataset available under 
https://faubox.rrze.uni-erlangen.de/getlink/fi9GsXoxUHagRAjApzgk7ywo/


## Datasets
The datasets are set up initially via the script dataset.py
They compromise of the following sets:
* 'ICFHR2022_train' - Original Papyri dataset for training
* 'ICFHR2022_test' - First test dataset provided for the competition
* 'ICFHR2022_artificial' - Dataset containing the synthetic papyri created by Google Fonts, ancient greek texts, 
some textures and PIL


### Dataset inspection
Inspect the dataset via a webbrowser (by help of the fiftyone package)
just call the script "Inspect_Ground_Truth.py" via command line
